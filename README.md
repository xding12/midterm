# Midterm Project

Name: Xiabo(Sharon) Ding
Website: http://csc174.org/midterm/xding/

## Domain
Financial market & weekly market update

## Choreography

The index page shows the main topic (financial market) and the second page shows the news in different markets.

For US investors who are paying attention to financial markets, in general, they always invest big portion of money into stock market due to its higher return with higher risk, and they also invest small portion of money into fixed-income market which performance is highly related with political news. According to the size of their investment in different markets, they first focus on stock market, and then political news. Within political news, they always first focus on what is happening in their country, which is the US, and then focus on what is happening in other countries, like UK.

## Ontology

- Each topic has a graph
- Each topic has a title
- Each topic has a summary of the article
- Each topic has more links related to itself

## Taxology

- Category of markets (Stock market and political news)
- Title of the topic
- More links about the topic

## Application of the Z-Pattern
- I put the main topic (Financial market) on the top left, because it is primary information
- I put sign-up section on the top right, because it is the secondary goal for users to do action
- I put brief description of financial market on the bottom left, because bottom left is a weak quadrant that less important information should be put 
- I put "Click to know updates about market", because it is the primary goal for the users to take action to read more about it

## Application of the F-Pattern
Horizontally, from left to right, I put graphs first to attract users' attention. And then I put content to present the news, which is relatively most important part in the webpage. Lastly, I put more links to let users understand more about the topic if they are interested.

## C.R.A.P Principles
I separate stock market and political news
- Contrast: I put background color, antiquewhite, for stock market, and background color, aliceblue, for policial news

- Repetition: I put background color, aliceblue, for both US news (Trump and mexico wall) and UK news (Brexit)

- Proximity: Two political news are put closer, relative to stock market

## Reasons I pick "Domine" and "Open Sans" fonts
My main topic is about financial market and present weekly market news in my second webpage. "Domine" is a perfect choice for newspapers or magazines websites, where text is the main focus. It perfectly matches my intention to present news as a focus.

Another font "Open Sans" for main content, it was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics, so that "Open Sans" is well paired with "Domine".

## Structure behind my CSS architecture
SMACSS with order: base, layout, module, state
